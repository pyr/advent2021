Advent of code 2021

To exercise solutions in both Ocaml and Clojure run `make`.
You will need `opam` installed as well as `clojure`.

Alternatively use `make clojure` or `make ocaml` respectively.
For ocaml, the `line_oriented` package was also installed, you
will need to `opam update` and `opam install line_oriented`
