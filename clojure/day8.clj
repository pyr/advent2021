;; Not super happy with part2, I feel like I'm missing an elegant solution

;; Sets are built for every input pattern and the value to resolve.
;; To translate the patterns into their corresponding digit value the naive
;; algorithm is used:
;; -1. we know upfront who 1, 4, 7, and 8 are
;; -2. of the candidates having six segments lit up, 9 is the one which
;;     has all the segments present for the digit 4. store it and drop from
;;     candidates
;; -3. of the remaining candidates having six segements, 0 is the one which
;;     has all the segments present for the digit 1. store it and drop from
;;     candidates
;; -4. store the remaining candidate having six segments as 6
;; -5. of the candidates having five segments lit up, 3 is the one which
;;     has all the segments present for the digit 1. store it and drop from
;;     candidates
;; -6. of the candidates having five segments lit up, 5 is the one which
;;     has all the segments present for the digit 4. store it and drop from
;;     candidates
;; -7. store the last one as 2 and return
